# Stage 1/6: Encrypted!
## Description
Today, encryption and decryption algorithms are everywhere to protect our data. They are vital for sites that handle sensitive data, such as e-commerce sites that accept online card payments and login areas that require users to enter their credentials. Complex encryption algorithms are behind the scenes to ensure the security of data.

In this project, you will learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages and texts using simple algorithms. We should note that such algorithms are not suitable for industrial use because they can easily be cracked, but these algorithms illustrate general ideas of encryption.

## Objectives
In the first stage, you need to manually encrypt the message `we found a treasure!` and print only the ciphertext (in lower case).

To encrypt a message, replace each letter with the letter that is in the corresponding position from the end of the English alphabet (a→z, b→y, c→x, ... x→c, y →b, z→a). Do not replace spaces or exclamation marks.

Use the given template to your program to print the ciphertext instead of the original message, no program input is required.

The output should look like `## ##### # ########!` where `#` is a lower-case English letter.
